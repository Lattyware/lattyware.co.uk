		<h1>G15Highlighter</h1>
		<p>This is a small project by <a href="http://www.lattyware.co.uk">Gareth Latty</a> (Lattyware).</p>
		<p><a href="/projects/">Other projects</a>.</p>
		<h2>About:</h2>
		<p>G15Highlighter is a python script by Lattyware for the Logitech G15 Keyboard and xChat. It displays any messages that highlights you in xChat on the G15's screen. The script is highly customisable, licenced under the GPL V3 and easy to use. The script will work as distributed, but you can customise the way it works via the configuration file (see further down the page for example configurations and explanations of each option).</p>
		<h2>Some images of what it looks like in-use:</h2>

		<h2>Comments:</h2>
		<p>If you have any comments on the script, feel free to <a href="mailto:info@lattyware.co.uk">e-mail me</a>. I'm always happy to hear about bugs, suggestions, praise, or even flames - whatever floats your boat. Please contact me if you have a custom configuration that you wish to share, or a modification you have made to the script.</p>
		<h2>Mandriva Issue:</h2>
		<p>I have been informed the script does not work with Mandriva 2008 spring edition's packages of g15tools (along with other scripts), but works when you compile from source.</p>
		<blockquote><p>I was also having problems with g15macro, and after messing around a bit I found my Thunderbird script was failing too.  The only difference between my old setup and my new setup when upgrading to 2008 spring edition was that 2008 spring had the g15daemon stuff in it's RPM repository so I didn't have to build it from source.  I uninstalled the RPMs and rebuilt the entire suite from source using the ./configure options I used to use, and everything works fine now.  I'm guessing Mandriva didn't build their RPMs with --enable-ttf.  I honestly don't know why that would cause relatively simple scripts that don't use ttf on composer to fail though.</p></blockquote>
		<p>Thanks to Frozen for the heads-up.</p>
		<h2>Get it:</h2>
		<p>The latest version is 2.6 - 	<a href="/projects/G15H.tar.gz">[name:G15H.tar.gz] - [size:19.151KB] - [md5sum:5e37c146057f6e1c8945c799800247fa]</a>. You will need xChat, Python and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/g15tools/">G15Tools</a> To install, extract into your xChat home directory (usually '~/.xchat2'). More in the readme.</p>
