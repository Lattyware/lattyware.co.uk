My name is Gareth Latty, and I'm a software developer - writing code to create software, websites and games.

I am currently a founding partner and developer at [Reread Games][reread].

I have a first-class honours degree in Computer Science from [the University of Leicester][uol]. I am currently working at [IBM][ibm] in Cambridge, as a developer in Intelligence Analysis.

I am interested in programming languages and language design, and enjoy working with a range of technologies. I'm a big fan of the [Python][python] language, which tends to be the focus of a lot of [the content I produce][code].

I enjoy reading, gaming, and a variety of music, TV and film. I take a lot of inspiration from these hobbies and try to experience as much of a range as I can.

I am particularly interested in issues related to freedoms and technology. I am an atheist, and believe in humanist ideals of maximizing happiness for all.
