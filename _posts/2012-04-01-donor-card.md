title: Donor Card

Today I received my donor card. Hopefully something that will go unused, but in the case something happens to me, I get to do something pretty awesome for someone else without any effort on my part. Cool stuff.

For those wondering, the picture was taken on my Kindle case, hence the orange. If you aren’t on the register, but want to be, it’s literally [a 2 minute form online](https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/register-to-donate/register-your-details/).

Just as a note, this isn’t some kind of weird April Fools, just happens to be the first.
