You can contact me directly via email at [gareth@lattyware.co.uk][email]. You can find [my public key on keybase.io][keybase], if you wish to utilise it.

Alternatively, you can also find me as [@Lattyware on Twitter][twitter], [Gareth Latty on StackOverflow][stackoverflow] and [lattyware on LinkedIn][linkedin].

Please do not contact me if you are from a recruitment agency - I am not interested in working with recruiters.
